Exerts influence through mirror-based dreams and psychological torture, appearing to victims in reflective surfaces to demand impossible moral choices. Ishkar tests devotion by demanding people sacrifice their most precious possessions or relationships. Those who refuse face escalating torment - mirrors crack in dreams, reflective surfaces show the Aurilith growing closer and more threatening. Victims report feeling watched through every mirror, window, or ice surface. When someone definitively refuses Ishkar's demands (like Gorga Snowjaw did), Sephek is dispatched as enforcement. Creates mirror phobia in those exposed to its influence - they must make WIS saves to look at reflective surfaces without fear.\n",
